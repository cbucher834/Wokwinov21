## How it works

Using DR flip flops and other basic logic, the device will count from binary 0000 up to binary 1111. The output pins will be pulled high when active.

## How to test

Connect a de-bounced button to input pin 0, and each time it's pulled high the binary output will incrament. 

## External hardware

A button and 4 LEDs are reccomended.
